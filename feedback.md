I knew car mods were expensive but holy moley!

## Technical requirements: Performing
* Car parts API would be a good idea for future builds 

## Creativity and Interface: Performing
* Including photos or pictures from an API could help your app look more organized.
* When you learn React, it could be a good idea to have the check box on the outside of the list, to be easier to access and change, or even modify with just a popup
* I love that this idea came from a personal spin for your own hobby.  

## Code Quality: Excelling
* I noticed that Mongo saying to use other methods in the terminal, like ```DeprecationWarning: Mongoose: `findOneAndUpdate()` and `findOneAndDelete()` without the `useFindAndModify` option``` this error doesn't affect your grade but it's something to keep in mind when presenting it to employers and such

## Functionality: Performing

## Planning / Process / Submission: Excelling
* It would also be good to include errors and roadblocks you faced while working on this project
* Very well organized Readme good work!
